Apple,"Apple fertilizers may be organic or non-organic, but the nutrients are the same to your trees. Both types can be applied to the soil or as sprays to apple leaves. Dry forms are available as well as several liquid organic fertilizers, including fish emulsion and seaweed "
Arcanut (Processed),"Because of potential pathogen exposure, raw manure should be avoided. Manure should be a minimum of 180 days old or fully composted before it’s added to growing areas. In addition to containing macronutrients, manure is also a great source of several trace nutrients essential for plant growth. Most cattle and horse manures have an average N-P-K ratio of 1-0.5-0.5 while poultry manures tend to be better high-nitrogen fertilizers (3-1-1 on average). The nutrients in manure are not immediately available to plants and can take up to several years to be released by soil microbes. In general, about half of the total nitrogen is available the first year, with the rest being released slowly over several subsequent seasons."
Arecanut,"A fertilizer dose of 100g N, 40g P2O2 and 140g K2O (200g of urea; 200g of rock phosphate and 230 g of muriate of Potash) per palm per year is recommended. 12kg of green leaf and 12kg compost or cattle manure should be applied every year."
Arhar/Tur,"Because peas are good foragers, they don't need much fertilizer - especially nitrogen. A day or two before planting, broadcast three to four pounds of 5-10-10 commercial fertilizer over each 100 square feet of garden space. Then work it into the top two to three inches of soil.Peas grow best in soil with a pH between 6 and 7.5. Use well-rotted manure or compost at planting. Continuous use of high phosphorus fertilizer such as 10-10-10 or 15-30-15, or high rates of manure or manure compost results in phosphorus buildup in the soil."
Ash Gourd,"Application of farmyard manure of 25 tonnes per hectare as the basal dose is required at the time of land/soil preparation. Fertilizers, 25 kg of P2O5 (full dose)/ha, 25 kg of K2O (full dose)/ha and 1/2 dose of Nitrogen (35 kg) should be applied.Gourds are fertilized the same way as cucumbers and melons. Incorporate 5-10-10 or a similar fertilizer (6-12-12) into the soil at planting, at a rate of 4 pounds per 100 feet of row. When the plant runners are 12 to 18 inches long, fertilize again spreading the fertilizer at least 18 inches away from the plant stems."
Atcanut (Raw),Beans are light feeders.They don't require much fertilizer. It's easy to give them just about all the nutrients they'll need by mixing a light dose of fertilizer into the top two to three inches of soil on planting day or the day before. Three to four pounds of commercial  or use the equivalent amount of nonchemical fertilizers  such as well-rotted manure  compost  bonemeal and cottonseed meal.fertilizer such as 5-10-10 per 100 square feet is sufficient for most garden soils
Bajra,"The balance fertilizers as per the soil test basis. Generally for hybrid varieties 80-100kg nitrogen,40-50kg phosphorous ,and 40kg potash is recommended, while composite varieties needs 40-50kg nitrogen, 25kg phosphorous ,and 25kg potash per hectare."
Banana,"Banana trees are heavy feeders so they need to be regularly fertilized to be productive. There are a couple of ways to feed the plant. When fertilizing a mature banana plant, use 1 ½ pounds of 8-10-10 per month; for dwarf indoor plants, use half that amount. Dig this amount in around the plant and allow it to dissolve each time the plant is watered. Stop fertilizing if the soil has a pH of 6.0 or under or when the plant."
Barley,"barley is either grown for malting or as a feed grain. This intended use affects the guidelines for nitrogen (N) use. Barley can replace corn in a livestock ration. It is a good alternative for corn where soils are droughty and corn yields are frequently limited by moisture stress.Nitrogen fertilizer guidelines can be based on the results of the soil NO3-N test or the consideration of expected yield, previous crop, and soil organic matter content. We suggest using the soil NO3-N."
Bean,"Nitrogen-rich fertilizers such as manure are often the first food we think of when it comes to plant growth. The exception for this is when growing beans and other legumes. That's because beans are nitrogen fixers, as they take nitrogen from the air and release it into the soil, fulfilling their own nitrogen needs. Giving your soil too much nitrogen fertilizer, combined with the nitrogen fixed by beans, can lead to too much stem and leaf growth, and too few or too small beans. The overly rapid stem and leaf growth additionally puts plants at risk for lower vigor and greater susceptibility to pests and diseases."
Beans & Mutter(Vegetable),"Because peas are good foragers, they don't need much fertilizer - especially nitrogen. A day or two before planting, broadcast three to four pounds of 5-10-10 commercial fertilizer over each 100 square feet of garden space. Then work it into the top two to three inches of soil."
Beet Root,"All plants need three major macro-nutrients: nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. Nitrogen drives the formation of leaves and is part of photosynthesis. Potassium enhances fruit development and increases resistance to disease. Phosphorus helps in the production of flowers and increases root growth and uptake.Proper soil pH must exist in soil in order for efficient nutrient uptake. Beets need a soil pH of 6.0 to 6.8 for optimum growth. The plants can tolerate a slighter higher pH, but no more than 7.0. is preferable. Perform a soil test to determine the status of pH levels prior to planting and tweak as necessary.Boron is necessary for feeding beet plants. Low levels of boron will cause black sunken spots on and in the root. Internal black spot can be prevented with ½ ounce of Borax per 100 square feet. Excess boron is damaging to some other food crops, so a soil test is necessary to indicate if Borax is needed."
Ber,"Because peas are good foragers, they don't need much fertilizer - especially nitrogen. A day or two before planting, broadcast three to four pounds of 5-10-10 commercial fertilizer over each 100 square feet of garden space. Then work it into the top two to three inches of soil.Peas grow best in soil with a pH between 6 and 7.5. Use well-rotted manure or compost at planting. Continuous use of high phosphorus fertilizer such as 10-10-10 or 15-30-15, or high rates of manure or manure compost results in phosphorus buildup in the soil."
Bhindi,"Mix 10-10-10 fertilizer into the soil with a shovel before planting to a depth of 4 inches, about 3 ounces for every 100 square feet of area. The numbers on the fertilizer label indicate the percentages of three critical nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. A 10-10-10 is said to be a “balanced” fertilizer in that it has equal amounts of these three critical nutrients.Reapply the fertilizer every four to six weeks during the growing season. Irrigate the soil each time you apply fertilizer."
Bitter Gourd,"The fertilizer doses to be applied depend on variety, fertility of soil, climate and season of planting.Generally well decomposed FYM (15-20 t/ha) is mixed with the soil during ploughing. Therecommended dose of fertilizer to be applied per hectare is 50-100 kg. N, 40-60 kg P2O5 and 30-60 kg   K2O. Half the N and entire P & K should be applied before planting. The balance N is given at the time of  flowering. The fertilizer is applied in a ring at 6-7 cm from the base of the stem. It is better to complete all the fertilizer applications just before the fruit set.Bitter gourd responds well to soil rich in organic matter and inorganic nutrients."
Black pepper,Manuring and fertilizer application.Application of lime or dolomite @ 500 g/vine in April - May during alternate years is recommended under highly acid soil conditions. Organic manures in the form of cattle manure or compost can be given @ 10 kg/vine during May.
Blackgram,"Because peas are good foragers, they don't need much fertilizer - especially nitrogen. A day or two before planting, broadcast three to four pounds of 5-10-10 commercial fertilizer over each 100 square feet of garden space. Then work it into the top two to three inches of soil.Peas grow best in soil with a pH between 6 and 7.5. Use well-rotted manure or compost at planting. Continuous use of high phosphorus fertilizer such as 10-10-10 or 15-30-15, or high rates of manure or manure compost results in phosphorus buildup in the soil."
Bottle Gourd,"Potassium. A large amount of potassium also aids in encouraging the bottle gourd to make fruit instead of more vines. When planting, the soil can be fertilized with one-fifth pound of potassium per 100 square feet. Potash is commonly used in organic gardens as a good source of potassium."
Brinjal,"Start by working lots of compost into the soil, plus 2 to 3 pounds of a complete fertilizer like 15-5-10 per 100 sq. ft. If you prefer, use an organic fertilizer like blood meal, well-rotted manure, cottonseed meal or bat guano. Burpee's Big Boy Tomato Food is also super for eggplants.When it comes to watering eggplants in container gardens, keep the potting soil constantly moist but not soggy."
Cabbage,"Apply 30 t/ha FYM, 90 kg N, 90 kg P and 90 kg K as basal and 45:45:45 kg NPK/ha on 30 to 45 days after planting. Apply 20 t/ha of FYM, 50 kg N, 125 kg P and 25 kg K/ha along with 2 kg Azospirillum as basal and 50 kg N after one month of planting and earth up.Add a nitrogen-heavy, liquid fertilizer (such as 21-0-0) once you determine the plants are ready. Put about 1/2 cup of the fertilizer into the mix for every 10 feet of cabbage row in your garden plot."
Cardamom,"If any cardamom plantations maintained under proper irrigation and soil management, biological NPK of 16-4-8 and 10-8-8 may replace the bulk application of acid forming fertilizers. PH buffered biological NPK is the best fit for Cardamom."
Carrot,"Carrots should be fertilized when the tops have reached 3 inches tall. A granular type fertilizer will work well, if used in moderation. Choose a fertilizer that has little nitrogen and more potassium and phosphate - 0-10-10 or 5-15-15 will work well.Carrots should be fertilized when the tops have reached 3 inches tall. A granular type fertilizer will work well, if used in moderation. Choose a fertilizer that has little nitrogen and more potassium and phosphate - 0-10-10 or 5-15-15 will work well."
Cashewnut,"Application of 10-15 kg of farmyard manure or compost annually is generally recommended for cashew. In addition, the current fertilizer recommendation is 500g N (1.1 kg urea), 125g P 2O 5(625g rock phosphate) and 125g K 2 O (208g muriate of potash) per tree per year."

Cashewnut Raw,"Application of 10-15 kg of farmyard manure or compost annually is generally recommended for cashew. In addition, the current fertilizer recommendation is 500g N (1.1 kg urea), 125g P 2O 5(625g rock phosphate) and 125g K 2 O (208g muriate of potash) per tree per year."
Castor seed,"The fertilizer dose recommended for castor is 40 N-40 P-20 K kg/ha. The entire dose of P and K and half of W is applied basally and the remaining half of W about 30 days after sowing, as and when the soil moisture is adequate."
Cauliflower,"Generally, the cauliflower crop is required to give 200 kg of Nitrogen, 75 kg of phosphorus and 75 kg potassium per hectare for optimum yield. Nitrogen 100 kg, 75 kg phosphorus and 75 kg potash should be applied at the time of transplanting.Cauliflower plants can be heavy feeders. Apply 1 to 2 pounds of an all-purpose fertilizer (20-20-20 per 100 feet of row). Side dress 3 weeks later with ammonium sulphate at rate of 1/2 cup per 10 feet of row."
Citrus Fruit,"All cultivars require proper fertilization for fruit development. Citrus trees are sensitive to a high salt concentration in the soil. Yield decrease due to soil salinity:0% at EC 1.7ds/m, 10% at 2.3ds/m, 25% at 3.3ds/m, 50% at 4.8ds/m, and 100% at EC 8 ds/m.The phosphorus requirements of citrus trees are low, so a good citrus fertilizer will have a nitrogen- and potassium-heavy N-P-K ratio such as 13-7-13."
Coconut,"From 5th year onwards, apply 50 kg of FYM or compost or green manure. 1.3 kg urea (560 g N), 2.0 kg super phosphate (320 g P2O5) and 2.0 kg muriate of potash (1200 g K2O) in two equal splits during June – July and December – January.Apply manures and fertilizers in circular basins of 1.8 m from the base of the palm, incorporate and irrigate.During 2nd, 3rd and 4th year ¼, ½ and ¾ doses of the above fertilizer schedule should be adopted respectively.Sufficient moisture should be present at the time of manuring.Fertigation may be done at monthly intervals with 75% of the recommended dose of the above fertilizers.Phosphorus may be applied as super phosphate in the basins and incorporated or as DAP through drip when good quality of water is available."
Coffee,"Growth medium: 150 ml/pot of (soil - 70% + manure - 30%). After emergence ( at a developmental stage of 2 leaves) Foliar spraying with 0.3% mixture of: 0.5 B + 2.2 Mg +7 Zn + 10 N.Coffee tree requires sufficient and regular supply of nutrients to produce high yield and good qualitybeans. Since it is a heavy feeder of nutrients, it extracts huge quantities of mineral nutrients from thesoil. Compost prepared from coffee processing by-products is therefore believed to supply much if not all of the mineral nutrients required by the coffee tree for optimal growth and sustainedyield. Varying nutrient composition figures of coffee pulp compost have been reported from different countries"
Colocosia,"Apply 25 tonnes of FYM, 20 kg N, 30 kg P and 60 kg K/ha as basal and 20 kg N, 30 kg P and 60 kg K/ha on 45 days after planting.Tubers and rooted plants should be planted 2 to 4 inches deep in the potting mix or soil. All elephant ear varieties are considered heavy-feeders, requiring rich, fertile, slightly acidic soil. Fertilize your plants once a month with a slow-release, water-soluble 20-20-20 fertilizer."
Cond-spcs other,"Each crop needs a different range of nutrients at every critical stage of its development. For example, nitrogen and phosphorous are often more critical at early stages of growth to fuel root and leaf development, whereas zinc and boron are important during flowering."
Coriander,"Apply Nitrogen@40kg in the form of Urea@90kg/acre in three splits. Apply half at the time of sowing and remaining in two equal splits after first and second cutting of leaves. When crop is grown for seed purpose, apply Nitrogen@30kg/acre i.e 65kg/acre in two doses, half at sowing time and remaining at time of flower initiation.To attain fast growth 15-20 days after germination take spray of Triacontanol hormone@20ml/10Ltr. Also one spray of N:P:K(19:19:19) fertilizer@75gm/15Ltr of water at 20 days of sowing helps in good and faster growth of crop. For obtaining more yield, spray Brassinolide@50ml/acre in150Ltr water, 40-50 days after sowing. Take second spray after 10 days. Also one spray of Mono ammoniumPhosphate 12:61:00@45gm/15Ltr of water at leaf and branches growing stage helps in good growth and increases yield."
Cotton(lint),"A common fertilization schedule applied by many cotton growers is adding 440 lbs. (200 kg) of N-P-K 20-10-10 per hectare during sowing (through the sowing machine), and 440 lbs. ... (250 kg) of ammonium nitrate, 400 lbs. (181 kg) of N-P-K 0-46-0 and 400 lbs. (181 kg) of N-P-K 0-0-50 per hectare throughout the year."
Cowpea(Lobia),"Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) ... Cowpea does not require too much nitrogen fertilizer because it fixes its own nitrogen from the air using the nodules in its roots. However, in areas where soils are poor in nitrogen, there is a need to apply a small quantity of about 15 kg of nitrogen as a starter dose for a good crop."
Cucumber,"Plants are heavy feeders, so be sure to feed the soil with rich compost or aged manure. After the vines develop runners and the first flowers appear, follow up with a side dressing of compost, aged manure, or fertilizer. If the leaves are yellowish, the plants need more nitrogen."
Drum Stick,"After the third month of sowing or planting, 100 grams of urea, 100 grams of superphosphate, and 50 grams of murate of potash should be applied to each plant or pit. During flowering time apply 100 grams of urea pet plant or pit."
Dry chillies,"A good 5-10-10 fertilizer is usually sufficient for peppers. Work it into the soil before transplanting, about 3 pounds per 100 square feet. ... Much, however, is affected by your soil, so you may want to consider a soil test if you are having issues."
Dry ginger,"Like most plants, ginger requires large amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, collectively called macronutrients. Still, too much nitrogen can burn the roots of a ginger plant, while too little can stall new growth. For ginger, choose a soil-mixed fertilizer with a 5-5-5 mixture of nutrients."
Garlic,"Fertilization of garlic plants should occur in the spring, if you planted in the fall. Fertilizing your garlic can occur either by side dressing or broadcasting fertilizer over the entire bed. The best garlic plant fertilizer will be high in nitrogen, those containing blood meal or a synthetic source of nitrogen."
Ginger,"Like most plants, ginger requires large amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, collectively called macronutrients. Still, too much nitrogen can burn the roots of a ginger plant, while too little can stall new growth. For ginger, choose a soil-mixed fertilizer with a 5-5-5 mixture of nutrients."
Gram,"Use Manures and Fertilizers of Gram crops. ... Chemical fertilizer requirement are also very less being a leguminous crop, only 10 -15 kilogram nitrogen, 30 kilogram phosphorus and 20 kilogram potash are suggested under irrigated condition and even less quantities are required for rainfed conditions."
Grapes,"Apply 5-10 pounds of poultry or rabbit manure, or 5-20 pounds of steer or cow manure per vine. Other nitrogen-rich grapevine fertilizers (such as urea, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate) should be applied after the vine has blossomed or when grapes are about ¼ inch across."
Groundnut,"Groundnut being a legume crop meets mostly its nitrogen requirement through fixation of nitrogen in the atmosphere. So, groundnut may not respond to large application of nitrogen fertilizers. Excess of nitrogen results in too much of vegetative growth at the expense of groundnut pod production."
Guar seed,"Manures and fertilizers needed for guar cultivation Clusterbean being a leguminous crop, needs a small quantity of nitrogen as a starter dose during early growth period. Clusterbean requires 20 kg N and 40 kg P2O5 per hectare. ... Fertilizer should be placed at least 5 cm below the seed."
Horse-gram,Horse gram seeds are treated with carbendazim (bavistin ) 2g for every k g of seeds. Biofungicide like Trichoderma viridi is recommended for pulses at the rate of 4g per kg seed. After fungicide treatment seed should be inoculated with Rhizobium and PSB culture @ 5 - 7 g/kg of seed.
Jack Fruit,"For jackfruit plantation, 1 x 1 x 1 m pits are dug at least 10 days before planting. About 30 kg well rotten farmyard manure and 500 g super phosphate are mixed with the soil of each pit and the pit is refilled. Approximately, 2 g/litre chloropyriphos should be applied in the pit to avoid insect attack."
Jobster,"The most widely used solid inorganic fertilizers are urea, diammonium phosphate and potassium chloride. Solid fertilizer is typically granulated or powdered."
Jowar,"20 kg N, 15 kg O2 P5 and 12 kg K2 O/ acre as basal dose and 15 kg N/acre as top dressing at 20-30 days after sowing. Under irrigation fertiliser dose can be increased to 80N and 40 P kg/ha. N should be applied in two splits, 50% at sowing and 50% as top dose at 30 days after sowing."

Beds and channels are formed depending on water resources.Top dressing of fertiliser:Apply 10 kg of N at 20 - 25 days after first weeding and then again on 35 - 40 days after second weeding as top dressing.During periods of drought and fertilizer shortage, spray 8 kg of urea as 2 per cent urea solution (20 g urea in one litre of water) on jute foliage on 40 - 45 as well as 70 - 75 DAS."
Jute & mesta,"Five tonnes of well decomposed farm yard manure is to be applied during last ploughing. Besides 20 kg per ha each of N, P2O5 and K2O are to be applied basally. Beds and channels are formed depending on water resources.In a medium fertile soil, the recommended dose of fertilizer for mesta is N-40kg/ha, P – 20 kg/ha and K-20kg/ha. Since, mesta is raised mainly under rainfed condition, the recommended dose of N in such cases is 25 kg/ha and it is mainly recommended."
Kapas,"Ludicious use of fertilizers, irrigation and clean cultivation will prevent early build-up of pests and helps to conserve natural enemies of pests. To enhance subsidiary growth to have maximum number of boll bearing branches, cut top of growing point of main branch at around 5 feet height. At the time of last ploughing apply well decomposed cow dung @ 5-10 ton for rainfed and 10-20 ton per acre for irrigated soil. It will help to conserved moisture in soil. Fertilizer doses for Cotton varieties, apply Urea@65 kg and DAP@27 kg or SSP@75 kg per acre. And in case of hybrids, apply 130 kg/acre of Urea and DAP@27 kg or SSP@75 kg/acre. If DAP@27 kg is used instead of SSP then reduced Urea dose by 10 kg.Apply whole dose of phosphorus in last ploughing. Apply half of Nitrogen fertilizer at time of thinning and remaining half at the appearance of first flower. For low fertile soil, apply half dose of Nitrogen at time of sowing. To reduce nitrogen loss from Urea mix 8 kg sulphur powder/ 50 kg Urea and apply in etween rows of standing crop.WSF: 80-100 days after sowing, if no or poor flowering is observed then to enhance flowering spray with multi micronutrient fertilizer@750 gm/acre/150 Ltr of water. In case bt varieties to improve yield, spray with 13:0:45@10 gm or Potash@5 gm/Ltr of water at evening time on 85, 95 & 105th days after sowing. Also to get higher yield, take alternate sprays of Potassium@10 gm/Ltr and DAP@20 gm/Ltr (2-3 sprays each at 15 days interval from first blooming). Sometime flower and square drop is observed then to control flower drop and to obtain good yield spray with Planofix(NAA) @4 ml and Multi Micronutrient fertilizer@120 gm, Magnesium Sulphate@150 gm/15 Ltr water. Due to bad weather effect boll drop is seen then to control, spray 00:52:34@100 gm+Humic acid(>12%) @30 ml+Sticker @6 ml in 15 Ltr water thrice at 10 days interval. Leaf reddening is deficiency observed now a day. It cause mainly due to lack of nutrient management. It can be corrected by proper fertilizer management. For thattake Foliar spray of MgSO41 kg, followed by Urea@2 kg in 100 Ltr water."
Khesari,"Use Manures and Fertilizers of Gram crops. ...

Korra,"Finger millet responds well to fertilizer application especially to N and P. The recommended doses of fertilizers vary from state to state for rainfed crop. Apply recommended dose of 40:20:20 N:P:K kg/ha was applied. With judicious application of farmyard manure, inorganic fertilizer efficiency is enhanced."
Lab-Lab,"Fertilizers in Indian Bean Cultivation:- Being a legume crop, it requires less nitrogen in the soil. Farm yard manure (FMY) of 5 to 8 tonnes, 10 kg of 'N' and 20 kg of 'P' should be applied in 1 hectare land at the time of sowing the seeds. In case of intercropping, inter-crops require separate fertilizer application."
Lemon,"Mature lemon trees should be fertilized every 1–2 months during the growing season and less often during the dormant period. The ratio of nitrogen: phosphorous: potassium, should be 2:1:1. There is a water-soluble fertilizer called “Miracid Soil Acidifier”, this fertilizer is 3:1:1, which works well for lemon trees.Mature lemon trees should be fertilized every 1–2 months during the growing season and less often during the dormant period. The ratio of nitrogen: phosphorous: potassium, should be 2:1:1. There is a water-soluble fertilizer called “Miracid Soil Acidifier”, this fertilizer is 3:1:1, which works well for lemon trees."
Lentil,"In lentil grown in calcareous alluvial soils, apply 1.6 kg of Boron per ha as basal to each crop. In soils, low in Zn, soil application of 20 kg Zinc Sulphate is recommended under rainfed and late sown condition; foliar spray of 2% urea improves yield."
Linseed,"NPK fertilizers are applied 5 to 10 cm away and below the seed in moist soil layers, especially under dryland cultivation. Depending on the soil type, about 40 kg P2O5 /ha is recommended for linseed. About K2O kg/ha is suggested. "
Litchi,"The nutrient requirements of litchi are very high. Apart from the major requirements N, P and K which contributes to profuse vegetative growth and flower initiation, micronutrients such as calcium, magnesium, zinc, boron and copper also play an important role in flowering and fruiting. In India, litchi is grown mostly in the fertile belt and hence very little or no fertilizer is given. However, soil analysis should be done to determine the exact doses of fertilizer.1/3 dose of nitrogen, 1/2 dose of potash, full dose of phosphorous and FYM should be given in the month of June-July just after the harvesting at a distance of 1.0 - 1.5 m from the main trunk of the tree. Beside that 20-25 gm copper sulphate, zinc sulphate and boron per plant per year should be given in the month of June-July. After the application of fertilizers, light irrigation should be done. 1/3 dose of nitrogen should be given in the month of February at the time of flowering. Remaining 1/2 dose of potash and 1/3 dose of nitrogen."
Maize,Spread 12.5 t/ha of FYM or compost or composted coir pith evenly on the unploughed field along with 10 packets of Azospirillum + Phosphobacteria 2 kg each/ha or Azophos at 4 kg/ha and incorporate in the soil. Apply NPK fertilizers as per soil test recommendation as far as possible.
Mango,"In general, fertilizers for bearing trees should contain 9 to 15 percent potassium and phosphorus should be reduced to 2 to 4 percent. Commonly available fertilizer mixes that are satisfactory for mango trees include 6-6-6 and 8-3-9-2, the 2 indicating magnesium.Mango trees need higher doses of nitrogen when young, but after they begin to bear fruit, they need less. Use a commercial organic fertilizer with a high percentage of potassium, such 5-8-10, for fruit-bearing trees, or apply these nutrients with organic materials."
Masoor,"The recommended dose of fertilizers is 20kg N, 40kg P, 20 kg K and 20kg S/ha. In soils low in Zinc, soil application of 20 kg ZnSO4 is recommended under rainfed and and late sown conditions. Foliar spray of 2% urea improves yield."
Mesta,"In a medium fertile soil, the recommended dose of fertilizer for mesta is N- 40kg/ha, P – 20 kg/ha and K-20kg/ha. Since, mesta is raised mainly under rainfed condition, the recommended dose of N in such cases is 25 kg/ha and it is mainly recommended."
Moong(Green Gram),10 cartloads (5 tones) of well-decomposed compost like cow dung or any other good compost should be spread along with a basal application of 120 kg superphosphate and 20 kg urea/acre. Irrigated condition : 50 kg P2O + 25 kg N + 50 kg P2O5 + 20 kg S /ha.
Moth,"Use Manures and Fertilizers of Gram crops. ... Chemical fertilizer requirement are also very less being a leguminous crop, only 10 -15 kilogram nitrogen, 30 kilogram phosphorus and 20 kilogram potash are suggested under irrigated condition and even less quantities are required for rainfed conditions."
Niger seed,"The price of fertilizer product remains the same as of the last report. The average price of NPK 15:15:15 is N8,500 dan lawal is still the only available brand. While NPK 20:10:10 golden and kasco are available at N8,500 and N5,800 respectively."
Oilseeds total,"Out of 16 essential elements, pulses specially need adequate amount of P, Ca, Mg, S and Mo. Phosphorus is required for proper root growth and growth of rhizobia. Calcium and magnesium are required to stimulate growth and to increase the size of the nodules, pod formation and grain setting."
Onion,Application of 15 kg sulphur/ha is sufficient for growing onion crops in soils having sulphur level above 25 kg/ha while 30 kg sulphur/ha is needed for soils having sulphur level below 25 kg/ha for optimum production of onion. Soil application of 50 kg S /ha is recommended for long day onion crops.
Orange,"Apply a slow-release nitrogen fertilizer solution, such as ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate or urea, three times per year -- once during early spring, early summer and early fall. Nitrogen fertilizers alone does not balance your orange tree's nutrition requirements."
Other  Rabi pulses,"Pulses are a low carbon footprint food When soil is fertilized with nitrogen in the form of manure, fertilizer, or crop residue, soil micro-organisms convert some of this nitrogen into nitrous oxide, which is a powerful greenhouse gas."
Other Cereals & Millets,"Millet responds well to fertilizer application especially to N and P. The recommended doses of fertilizers vary from state to state for rainfed crop. Apply recommended dose of 40:20:20 N:P:K kg/ha was applied. With judicious application of farmyard manure, inorganic fertilizer efficiency is enhanced."
Other Citrus Fruit,"The phosphorus requirements of citrus trees are low, so a good citrus fertilizer will have a nitrogen- and potassium-heavy N-P-K ratio such as 13-7-13.All citrus trees will benefit from a slightly nitrogen rich or balanced NPK fertilizer that also has some micro-nutrients in it like: magnesium,manganese,iron,copper,zinc,boron,Citrus trees also like to have somewhat acidic soil, so an acidic fertilizer can also be beneficial in citrus tree fertilizing, though not required. The easiest citrus fertilizer to use is the kind made specifically for citrus trees."
Other Dry Fruit,"Most tree fertilizers contain a blend of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, or NPK.You will usually see the ratio of these ingredients printed on the bag. It’s usually 10-10-10 or 12-12-12. A balanced ratio of these 3 things makes the fertilizer safe to use on most trees.In addition to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, plants also need calcium for strong cell walls and overall health, magnesium for seed formation and regulation, and sulfur which is necessary to create the chlorophyll needed for photosynthesis."

A balanced ratio of these 3 things makes the fertilizer safe to use on most trees.In addition to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, plants also need calcium for strong cell walls and overall health, magnesium for seed formation and regulation, and sulfur which is necessary to create the chlorophyll needed for photosynthesis."
Other Kharif pulses,"Out of 16 essential elements, pulses specially need adequate amount of P, Ca, Mg, S and Mo. Phosphorus is required for proper root growth and growth of rhizobia. Calcium and magnesium are required to stimulate growth and to increase the size of the nodules, pod formation and grain setting."
Other Vegetables,"Most summer vegetables are heavy feeders, with corn and tomatoes being some of the heaviest nitrogen consumers. To provide consistent nutrients for fruit-producing plants, add quick-release fertilizer to the soil every three to four weeks. Before planting the summer garden, work slow-release fertilizer into the soil."
Paddy,"In addition, we compared the performance of three types of nitrogenous fertilizer (urea, ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate) on growth and yield. Urea had the highest nitrogen efficiency and should therefore be the fertilizer of choice for the cultivation of paddy rice in developing countries."
Papaya,"For papaya, fertilizers should be applied once in every two months. Although fertilizer application in a particular region depends on the soil and leaf analysis, generally 90 g of Urea, 250 g of Super phosphate and 140 g of Muriate of Potash per plant are recommended for each application."
Peach,"A good fertilizer for peach trees is one that has an even balance of the three major nutrients, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. For this reason, a good peach tree fertilizer is a 10-10-10 fertilizer, but any balanced fertilizer, such as 12-12-12 or 20-20-20, will do. When you are fertilizing peach trees, the fertilizer shouldn’t be placed near the trunk of the tree. This can cause damage to the tree and will also prevent the nutrients from reaching the roots of the tree. Instead, fertilize your peach tree about 8-12 inches from the trunk of the tree. This will get the fertilizer out to a range where the roots can take the nutrients up without the fertilizer causing tree damage."
Pear,"In general, pear trees thrive when macronutrients like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K) are present. Nitrogen helps encourage vegetative growth (leaves and branches).: Spray copper before the fall rains; spray lime-sulfur two to three times beginning in fall, again during winter, and finally in March just before buds open; spray dormant oil in early spring before buds open and wettable sulfur just after petal fall."
Peas  (vegetable),"Because peas are good foragers, they don't need much fertilizer - especially nitrogen. A day or two before planting, broadcast three to four pounds of 5-10-10 commercial fertilizer over each 100 square feet of garden space. Then work it into the top two to three inches of soil.Peas grow best in soil with a pH between 6 and 7.5. Use well-rotted manure or compost at planting. Continuous use of high phosphorus fertilizer such as 10-10-10 or 15-30-15, or high rates of manure or manure compost results in phosphorus buildup in the soil."
Peas & beans (Pulses),"Because peas are good foragers, they don't need much fertilizer - especially nitrogen. A day or two before planting, broadcast three to four pounds of 5-10-10 commercial fertilizer over each 100 square feet of garden space.Determine fertilizer needs by a soil test. In general, 600 to 800 pounds of 10-10-10 per acre is adequate if at least ½ of the fertilizer is placed 3 inches to the side and slightly below the seed. Do not use more than 600 pounds in band placement because beans are highly susceptible to fertilizer burn."
Perilla,Newly planted trees should be fertilized only lightly until they have become well established. This usually is not until after their first growing season.Mature trees may need fertilization every two or three years to maintain good foliage color and vigor.
Pineapple,"A dry fertilizer that contains 6 to 10 percent nitrogen, 6 to 10 percent potash, 6 to 10 percent phosphoric acid and 4 to 6 percent magnesium works well. Young pineapple plants should be fertilized every two months or so during the growing season.Coffee grounds are rich in Nitrogen. Pineapples love them. ... The additional Nitrogen inhibits blooming. I stopped sprinkling the grounds, added a little manure mixture, plenty of water (it's been dry lately.)"
Plums,"For newly planted plums, fertilize in the early spring by broadcasting one cup of 10-10-10 fertilizer over an area that is roughly three feet across. In mid-May and mid-July, apply a ½ cup of calcium nitrate or ammonium nitrate evenly over an area about two feet in diameter.Plum trees will produce flowers and fruit any time up to five years. Until they flower, feed with a general purpose fertiliser that you can add to water. Once the tree starts to flower, change this to a feed high in potash, like tomato food, which encourages good flowering and fruiting."
Pome Fruit,"Pome fruits require potassium, magnesium, calcium and a bit of boron. Pome fruits do not require a great deal of nitrogen fertilizer. In fact, excess nitrogen can: Favor vegetative growth over fruit production."
Pome Granet,"A pomegranate tree needs adequate nitrogen for best growth, because nitrogen supports growth of foliage and production of flowers that eventually set fruit. You can use ammonium sulfate, a high-nitrogen fertilizer, or a balanced 10-10-10 formula, starting in spring after the tree begins to show new growth."
Potato,"So they need to be incorporated into the soil before planting. Using 15 pounds of 15-15-15 fertilizer per 1,000 square feet of soil or 23 pounds of 10-10-10 fertilizer per 1,000 square feet of soil is recommended.Because potatoes need adequate fertilizer early in the season, apply most of the fertilizer just before planting. Use 2 to 3 pounds of complete fertilizer such as 10- 20-10 for each 30 feet of row in bands 2 inches to each side and 1 inch below the seed piece. Do not allow the fertilizer to touch the seed piece."
Pulses total,"Out of 16 essential elements, pulses specially need adequate amount of P, Ca, Mg, S and Mo. Phosphorus is required for proper root growth and growth of rhizobia. Calcium and magnesium are required to stimulate growth and to increase the size of the nodules, pod formation and grain setting."
Pump Kin,"Apply a weekly nitrogen-heavy fertilizer early in the growing season to produce a healthy plant. Once the flowers start to form, switch to a phosphorus-heavy fertilizer for plentiful blossoms. When the actual pumpkins appear, use a potassium-rich fertilizer for healthy fruit."
Ragi,"Finger millet responds well to fertilizer application especially to N and P. The recommended doses of fertilizers vary from state to state for rainfed crop. Apply recommended dose of 40:20:20 N:P:K kg/ha was applied. With judicious application of farmyard manure, inorganic fertilizer efficiency is enhanced."
Rajmash Kholar,Manures and Fertilizers in Red Kidney Beans Farming:- This crop lack biological Nitrogen fixation due to poor nodulation. Therefore it needs good amount of Nitrogen about 100 to 125 kg/ha. This crop also requires 60 to 70 kg of P2O5/ha and adding potassium hardly effects the yield.
Rapeseed &Mustard,"Apply 15-20 tonnes of FYM or compost at the time of field preparation. And 60-90kg nitrogen, 60 kg P2O5 and 40 kg K2O per hectare. Split application of nitrogen has been found useful for rape and mustard crop."
Redish,"Radish is a quick growing crop, hence the soil should be highly rich in plant nutrients. Add farmyard manure 25-40 tonnes, nitrogcn 18-50 kg in the form of ammonium sulphate, phosphorus 50 kg in the form of superphosphate and potash 50 kg in the form of muriate of potash for one hectare of the field."
Ribed Guard,Manure and Fertilizers of Ridge gourd plants 40 to 50 cartload well decomposed Farm Yard Manure should be applied at the time of soil or field preparation. Apply a fertilizer dose of 250:100:100 kg NPK / ha throughout the Ridge gourd cropping period through the split application.
Rice,Proper phosphorus (P) nutrition is critical for producing maximum rice grain yields. Phosphorus is very important in the early vegetative growth stages. Phosphorus promotes strong early plant growth and development of a strong root system.
Ricebean (nagadal),Proper phosphorus (P) nutrition is critical for producing maximum rice grain yields. Phosphorus is very important in the early vegetative growth stages. Phosphorus promotes strong early plant growth and development of a strong root system.
Rubber,"Fertilize the rubber tree with a 10-10-10 nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium slow-release granular fertilizer beginning in the spring, after active growth begins. Apply the fertilizer at a rate of 1 tablespoon per square foot of soil."
Saflower,"Manures and fertilizers In areas, where irrigations is possible, 40:40:20 kg/ha N:P2O5 :K2O should be applied at the time of sowing. The fertilizers should be applied in furrows 8-10 cm deep and 4-5 cm away from the seed at the time of planting."
Samai,Most gardeners should use a complete fertilizer with twice as much phosphorus as nitrogen or potassium. An example would be 10-20-10 or 12-24-12. These fertilizers usually are easy to find. Some soils contain enough potassium for good plant growth and don't need more.
Sannhamp,"If growers can't or won't soil test, a standard treatment is 100 to 150 pounds per acre of P2O5 applied as superphosphate, 0-20-20 fertilizer or the equivalent. Sunn hemp is fairly drought tolerant, but needs at least an acre inch of moisture for optimum growth."
Sapota,"Manure and Fertilizer Requirements for Sapota Plants.The Sapota trees need a foliar spray of NPK, Mg and Zn during the fruit set period so that the size of the fruit is improved. Application of nitrophoska 8: 12: 24:4 @ 100 g/tree has proved to be beneficial for the growth of Sapota trees."
Sesamum,"Sidedressing with a nitrogen-bearing fertilizer may be necessary when growing plants are unthrifty and light green in color. Sesame will require approximately 40 to 80 pounds of nitrogen per acre on irrigated production and 25 to 60 pounds of nitrogen per acre on dryland production,"
Small millets,"Potassium-rich basal fertilizers like N.P.K 17.17. 17 should also be applied. These fertilizers induce flowering, promote good grain filling and quality, increase crop resistance to infections and weather stress, ensure a balanced crop growth, improve crop productivity and promote tillering, among other benefits."
Snak Guard,Manure and Fertilizers of Snake Gourd:40 to 50 cartload well decomposed organic Farm Yard Manure (FMY) should be applied at the time of soil or mainland preparation. 100 grams of NPK 6:12:12 mixture as basal dose/pit and N @ 10 grams/ pit 30 days after sowing the seeds.
Soyabean,"Manure. Some growers will apply livestock manures to soybean fields, instead of corn. Manure is an excellent source of phosphorus (P), potassium (K), all secondary nutrients and micronutrients."
Sugarcane,"For sugarcane, apply 12.5 t/ha of FYM before the last ploughing.An average well decomposed farmyard manure contains 0.5 per cent N, 0.2 per cent P2O5and 0.5 per cent K2O. When cow dung and urine are mixed, a balanced nutrition is made available for cane growth.Press Mud is a by-product of sugar industry. For every 100 tonnes of sugarcane crushed about 3 tonnes of press mud cake is left behind as by-product.Apply 37.5 t/ha of press mud before planting. It contains 1.2%N, 2.1-2.4% P2O5 and 2.0% K2O.It contains trace quantity of micronutrients and prevents soil erosion, crusting and cracking, adjust soil pH, improves drainage and promotes normal bacterial and microbial growth in the soil."
Sunflower,"Sprinkle a low-nitrogen fertilizer, such as a 5-10-10 blend, over the bed. The amount of fertilizer needed varies depending on the fertilizer, but generally, one-half cup per 25 square feet is sufficient. Use the lowest application recommendation on the fertilizer label for sunflowers."
Sweet potato,"Experts vary in their recommendations for the exact ratio of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus to add. But, depending on results of your soil sample, a 1-2-4 or 5-10-10 fertilizer mix should provide the right balance to ensure healthy growth of young sweet potatoes."
Tapioca,"Application of chemical fertilizers can definitely increase tapioca yield. It is convenient to use, but costly. Generally, the recommended compound fertilizer grades are 15-15-15 and 13-13-21, because they are largely available. The optimal rate of application is 300-600 kgs per hectare, all at one time."
Tea,"Zinc sulphate should be applied within 7 - 14 days after ground fertiliser application. If deficiency symptoms of nitrogen (general yellowing) are observed, apply 2 to 4% of urea. Apply 8 to 16 kg of urea per ha in 400 l of water, as and when necessary."
Tobacco,"A tobacco fertilizer should contain little or no chlorine and most of the nitrogen should be in the nitrate form. Fertilizer manufactured for use on tomato, pepper, and potato should be satisfactory for tobacco. Seed should be sown about 50-60 days prior to the desired date of transplanting."
Tomato,"Cottonseed meal is also a good choice as a natural tomato fertilizer that can be mixed into your soil at the time of planting. It contains nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in about a 6-2-1 ratio; it's nitrogen supports leafy growth early in the young tomato plants' growth cycle."
Total foodgrain,"Where wheat or oats follow corn, sorghum or rice, application of 15 to 20 pounds of nitrogen per acre in the fall may be beneficial. Spring Topdressing: Nitrogen is a necessary nutrient for growth of wheat and oats."
Turmeric,"Apply fertilizer at a rate of 1 to 2 lbs (depending on soil fertility) per planting row foot. A good quality composted poultry-based manure is commonly used. Early in the growing season, turmeric appreciates more nitrogen to support leafy growth."
Turnip,"It is hard to determine which is more healthful, as turnip greens have a different nutrient composition to the roots. Turnip greens are an excellent source of vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin C, folate, copper, and manganese. Both the greens and the roots are great sources of fiber."
Urad,The recommended fertilizer dose for black gram is 20:40:40 kg NPK/ha. Fertilizer dose should be applied as per soil test report.
Varagu,"Out of 16 essential elements, pulses specially need adequate amount of P, Ca, Mg, S and Mo. Phosphorus is required for proper root growth and growth of rhizobia. Calcium and magnesium are required to stimulate growth and to increase the size of the nodules, pod formation and grain setting."
